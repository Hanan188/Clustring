You have an unlabeled dataset. The task is to implement models (k-means algorithm- agglomerative algorithm) to describe the data by grouping samples depending on the common properties among them. Dataset: You are owing a supermarket mall, and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. You assign a spending score to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.. According to your knowledge in the machine learning field, employ some algorithms that help you to detect some hidden patterns about your customers.
